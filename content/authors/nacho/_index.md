I’ve always wanted to be a therapist, but at some point during my degree, I realized that learning about the brain could be a fantastic adventure. Here I am, studying a PhD in neuroscience, without any hint about my next step. I love jazz music, reading and sports. I have an identical twin, and every time I can, I grab my backpack and go to travel abroad.

My scientific interests range from basic psychology to theoretical statistics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational Neuroscience. As a neuroscientist, I’m amazed by the fact that from a bunch of -simple (whatever that means) - interconnected neurons, mind and self-consciousness arise.
