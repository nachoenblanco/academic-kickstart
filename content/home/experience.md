Application of the methods developed in my doctoral thesis to the dataset acquired in the BMU: 1) analyses of complexity/entropy, 2) functional brain networks construction, and 3) network metrics analysis. All methods were applied to resting-state fMRI time series from healthy, young population (14-25 y.o). The main goal is to explore the interplay between the evolution of the functional networks and the complexity and entropy of its time series, and how these changes are related to brain maduration.
